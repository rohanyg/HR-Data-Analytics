- It helps in better utilisation of the resources like doing team meeting on a day when majority of the people are present in the company.

### Limitations 

- Human behavior is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While data analytics can reveal correlations, it might not always provide a complete understanding of the underlying causes. 
- It might not always accurately predict future behavior. For instance, trends observed in the past might not hold in the future due to changing circumstances within the organization or external factors.
- Misinterpretation of results can lead to inappropriate decision-making.
